## Inspiration💡
We have seen that many doctors👩🏼‍⚕️👩🏻‍⚕️ find it hard to identify a new type of disease🦠, so we decided to collect data from others so our AI🤖 would analyze it. It would be easy for doctors👩🏼‍⚕️ to determine what the patient🤒 is suffering from. And we want to store data somewhere secured and easily accessed, and no one can tamper with it.

## What it does💪🦈
Once the user👤 signs up on our platform, they can enter⌨️ the data whenever they want. Then data will send it to our AI🤖 to analyze the patient details .and this result, along with data, will be uploaded to the Hedera thing and later which can be used as a Web3/Dapp application.

## How we built it❓🧠
We made our website using Flask🐍, bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and js.
Using Flask with python, we run our back end, and then we built an AI🤖  which analyzes the disease🤢 by symptoms and database, and then, from that endpoint, we linked it with  Hedera so Hedera would store data in the infura network.🧱⛓️.

## Challenges we ran into🧗
We faced trouble😵‍💫 using hedera at the start as there were not many resources, but later we went through the documentation📃 and figured😃 out how to use hedera for our project.

##  What we learned and Accomplishments that we're proud of👨‍🎓🎗️🏆
We are happy😀 that we learned how to make a good AI🤖 trained on datasets. Also, we enjoyed🥳 using hedera for our project for storing data🔡 in their network🥅.

## What's next for Healee🔮
We are considering making it more accurate by giving more input and implementing user dashboards.
